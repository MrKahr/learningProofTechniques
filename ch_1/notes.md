## Definitions (as precisely as I can!)

### Statement
A statement is a declarative statement that is either true or false. 

### Mathematical deduction 
A process of deriving conclusions from premises e.g. axioms(atomic rules), definitions, previously proved lemmas(subresults), or theorems (major reslts) 

### Argument 
Assume we want to prove that a statement S is true (often a theorem or a lemma). 

Using helper statements P,Q,R,$\dots$, we can show that S must follow from P,Q,R,$\dots$ assuming that these statements are true.   

### Well-formedness
A statment can be well-formed if it does not violate the syntax of mathematical statements.

## Operators and notiation
### Connective symbols  
| Symbol(Syntax)            | Meaning(Semantics)| Natural language expression (not 1-1 correspondence!) | Mathematical  
| -----------               | -----------       | -----------   
| $P \lor Q$: Disjunction   | or                | Either P or Q
| $P \land Q$: Conjunction  | and               | P and Q, Both P and Q
| $\neg P$: Negation        | not               | Not P
