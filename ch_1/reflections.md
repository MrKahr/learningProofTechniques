# Important reflections 

## Natural language is really hard to unambgiously map to logical statements 
- [See the use of both, neither, nor etc](/ch_1/solutions.md#1.1.4)

## A parser for logical language will have to include 
- An error system that informs the user when a clause is not well-formed

## The following logical properties are interesting - you might want to consider those: 
- Validity
- Soundness

## Logic insights
- There are many different kinds of logics that are supersets of each other - it works similarly to problem classes in comp. sci. e.g. NP, NP-hard, NP-complete etc.
